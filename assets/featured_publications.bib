  abstract = {This study presents a theory about dynamic game characters within a broader character ecology in which characters are constantly produced and reproduced in a variety of media. Characters do not appear only in games, they migrate from one medium to another. They are independent from any medium in particular: a character does not require a specific medium to come into existence. Authoritative forces try to shape the overall interpretation of circulating characters transmedially in comics, television series, films, games and more through different venues of control, such as authorship, canonisation and ownership or intellectual property. This study addresses the struggle for interpretive authority by explaining how the player constructs the identity of dynamic game characters in digital games, and by discussing how dynamic game characters connect to and influence other character manifestations within a broader media ecology in which characters circulate. The research question of this study is: What are dynamic game characters? Through reader-response theory adapted for cybermedia phenomena such as games, this study approaches characters as a player-constructed phenomenon, in which the game character needs the player in order to be invoked, but the game encourages the meaning-making process with different means to different effects. Dynamic game characters are those game characters whose development structures branch into different outcomes, each of which are undetermined until the player actualises one or more possibilities that steer that direction onto distinct paths with a specific outcome. Dynamic game characters have become a phenomenon that challenges practices of (trans-)media control. A theory of dynamic game characters tells us about the migration of entities via different works, and how the perceiver comes to understand them within a context saturated with characters, stories and a variety of media platforms. Digital games are just one of the many media platforms that participate in this character ecology, and they allow characters to challenge the idea that within a single piece of work the character must maintain a linear, continuous and coherent identity that stretches the understanding of characters as authored and predictable within a single work. This study argues that dynamic game characters are a type of quasi-person in digital games whose development consists of multiple outcomes. Digital games accelerate a dynamic game character's identity within a single work, unlike non-cybermedia in which a character's identity is constructed over multiple works. They challenge venues of control, because the player has creative agency over the dynamic game character's characterisation process within a single work. However, once dynamic game characters transfer to other works, authoritative institutions break the player's participation in the dynamic game character's development. These transfers sacrifice player participation to create the illusion of a coherent identity between the manifestations of the character over multiple works.},

  abstract = {The relationship between humankind and technology is fundamental, but also a longstanding source of unease, particularly as that relationship has become ever more intimate and irreversible. In this paper, I connect this age-old anxiety with the age-old figure of the giant, a monster similarly intertwined with ancient questions on the boundaries of humanity. I focus on two examples: the Human-Reaper larva in Mass Effect 2 and Liberty Prime in Fallout 3 and 4. Although different in approach, these examples demonstrate a use of a phenomenon I call the `techno-giant' to explore and reflect the powerful anxieties in our cultures to do with the future of the human\textendash{} technology relationship. In particular, both examples expose the human\textendash nonhuman boundary as being exceeding difficult to define and place, despite a constant desire to. The figure of the giant offers a powerful focal point for these representations.},

  abstract = {Computer games and board games alike are cultural artifacts that reflect the ideas of their creators and the society in which they are embedded and played. Like cinema and literature, they may represent more or less familiar environments, events and beings. That said, there are great differences between these media, which also affects how they can be understood as representational artifacts. In addition to this, when considering a game such as Tetris, it is not even given that games represent in the first place. This raises the question of what it is that makes us consider games as representational artifacts and subsequently, which representational capacities, or better, meaning-producing capacities and practices we may associate with them? Furthermore, to what extend are games a medium and how do they relate to other media? This dissertation reviews theories of representation and their application to game analysis. Based on these theories, I propose a media-centered, and materialist framework for conceptualizing and analyzing games as simulations. With this, I will address games as objects, consisting of a multimodal surface expression that is governed by an underlying mechanical structure and realized in a material medium. The framework describes the basic qualities of a given game through what I call the material, structural, communicational and agential modalities. I will discuss the ways in which simulations refer to a target, a relationship which I argue is not intrinsic to the simulation itself, but remains relative to interpretation. Consequently, the study of representation should not only consider the game artifact in itself, but also the context in which it is produced and consumed. Therefore, the analysis will progress from the relatively formal analysis of games as simulations to a discussion of games as cultural artifacts that are discursively constructed as what I call qualified media. These qualified media have evolved side by side with other media, and are governed by a set of normative assumptions about what games are, what they should look like, how they should be played and by whom. Finally, the dissertation will offer a demonstration of the proposed framework in an analysis of the ways in which gender is represented in the computer game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. This analysis will first consider the formal elements of the game, that is the material, structural, visual and textual aspects and how they are put into operation by a player. Next, the case study situates the game and its construction of gender in a broader cultural context in which games intersect with other media and are produced and consumed according to certain cultural conventions and norms.},

  abstract = {Imitation Learning (IL) is a machine learning approach to learn a policy from a set of demonstrations. IL can be useful to kick-start learning before applying reinforcement learning (RL) but it can also be useful on its own, e.g. to learn to imitate human players in video games. Despite the success of systems that use IL and RL, how such systems can adapt in-between game rounds is a neglected area of study but an important aspect of many strategy games. In this paper, we present a new approach called Behavioral Repertoire Imitation Learning (BRIL) that learns a repertoire of behaviors from a set of demonstrations by augmenting the state-action pairs with behavioral descriptions. The outcome of this approach is a single neural network policy conditioned on a behavior description that can be precisely modulated. We apply this approach to train a policy on 7,777 human demonstrations for the build-order planning task in StarCraft II. Dimensionality reduction is applied to construct a low-dimensional behavioral space from a high-dimensional description of the army unit composition of each human replay. The results demonstrate that the learned policy can be effectively manipulated to express distinct behaviors. Additionally, by applying the UCB1 algorithm, the policy can adapt its behavior - in-between games - to reach a performance beyond that of the traditional IL baseline approach.},
