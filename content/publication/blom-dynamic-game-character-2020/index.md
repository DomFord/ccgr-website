abstract: "This study presents a theory about dynamic game characters within a broader\
  \ character ecology in which characters are constantly produced and reproduced in\
  \ a variety of media. Characters do not appear only in games, they migrate from\
  \ one medium to another. They are independent from any medium in particular: a character\
  \ does not require a specific medium to come into existence. Authoritative forces\
  \ try to shape the overall interpretation of circulating characters transmedially\
  \ in comics, television series, films, games and more through different venues of\
  \ control, such as authorship, canonisation and ownership or intellectual property.\
  \ This study addresses the struggle for interpretive authority by explaining how\
  \ the player constructs the identity of dynamic game characters in digital games,\
  \ and by discussing how dynamic game characters connect to and influence other character\
  \ manifestations within a broader media ecology in which characters circulate. The\
  \ research question of this study is: What are dynamic game characters? Through\
  \ reader-response theory adapted for cybermedia phenomena such as games, this study\
  \ approaches characters as a player-constructed phenomenon, in which the game character\
  \ needs the player in order to be invoked, but the game encourages the meaning-making\
  \ process with different means to different effects. Dynamic game characters are\
  \ those game characters whose development structures branch into different outcomes,\
  \ each of which are undetermined until the player actualises one or more possibilities\
  \ that steer that direction onto distinct paths with a specific outcome. Dynamic\
  \ game characters have become a phenomenon that challenges practices of (trans-)media\
  \ control. A theory of dynamic game characters tells us about the migration of entities\
  \ via different works, and how the perceiver comes to understand them within a context\
  \ saturated with characters, stories and a variety of media platforms. Digital games\
  \ are just one of the many media platforms that participate in this character ecology,\
  \ and they allow characters to challenge the idea that within a single piece of\
  \ work the character must maintain a linear, continuous and coherent identity that\
  \ stretches the understanding of characters as authored and predictable within a\
  \ single work. This study argues that dynamic game characters are a type of quasi-person\
  \ in digital games whose development consists of multiple outcomes. Digital games\
  \ accelerate a dynamic game character's identity within a single work, unlike non-cybermedia\
  \ in which a character's identity is constructed over multiple works. They challenge\
  \ venues of control, because the player has creative agency over the dynamic game\
  \ character's characterisation process within a single work. However, once dynamic\
  \ game characters transfer to other works, authoritative institutions break the\
  \ player's participation in the dynamic game character's development. These transfers\
  \ sacrifice player participation to create the illusion of a coherent identity between\
  \ the manifestations of the character over multiple works."
