# PhD Education

The Center for Computer Games Research has been home to a number of International PhD fellows since the first dissertation was completed in 2003. For more information on the ITU's upcoming PhD calls please visit the university's main [information site](http://itu.dk/en/Forskning/Phd-uddannelsen). We also run special PhD level courses on the subject of computer games and those are publicized via our [Events page](https://game.itu.dk/index.php/Events).

The Center for Computer Games Research only accepts applicants whose research interests lie within those of the Center's faculty. Prospective PhD applicants are thus advised to become familiar with the research areas of the faculty members. At least one of the supervisors must be at the associate professor level. Applicants are encouraged to contact a potential supervisor to discuss their research focus before applying. The statement of purpose to be included in the application needs to clearly set out the scope of the project and proposed method, as well as situate its relevance to the field and originality. The project must be able to be realistically completed within the three-year time-frame allotted for the PhD. This means that applicants must have a solid background in the methods and disciplines they utilize.

Visiting PhD students from other institutions are welcome depending on capacity and relevance to the research of at least one faculty member.

# Masters Education

Our two-year MSc programme in Games provides you with technical and social science knowledge on how computer games work, how they are designed and how they have a social impact on us. You will work with some of the worldâ€™s leading game researchers, and you will have the opportunity to become a computer games expert yourself. We are currently offering two programmes, in respectively Game Technology, with a focus on programming, and Game Design and Theory. More information about the games programme can be found [here](http://en.itu.dk/Programmes/MSc-Programmes/Games).
