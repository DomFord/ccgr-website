# Master's Education

Our two year MSc in Games offers the chance to become a game creator of the future. Based on a solid foundation of creative, technical, social, and analytical competences, you will realize the playful experiences of tomorrow. By understanding the complex creative process of game production, and how interdisciplinary teams work together, students are able to make a difference in any project that uses game technology or playful design.

The MSc in Games provides theoretical, practical, and technical knowledge on how computer games are made, how they create meaning, and how they socially impact us. Students work with some of the worldâ€™s leading games researchers, explore cutting edge technologies for their playful potential, and become experts in how to realize creative projects in interdisciplinary teams. Students learn how to use design methods, analytical tools, critical thinking, and scientific research to drive innovation.

The Games Programme has a Technology Track that builds on a computers science bachelor and a Design Track that focusses on game design, theory, and production processes in creative projects.

# PhD Education

The Center for Computer Games Research has been home to a number of International PhD fellows since the first dissertation was completed in 2003. For more information on the ITU's upcoming PhD calls please visit the university's main [information site](http://itu.dk/en/Forskning/Phd-uddannelsen). We also run special PhD level courses on the subject of computer games and those are publicized via our [events page](https://game.itu.dk/index.php/Events).

The Center for Computer Games Research only accepts applicants whose research interests lie within those of the Center's faculty. Prospective PhD applicants are thus advised to become familiar with the research areas of the faculty members. At least one of the supervisors must be at the associate professor level. Applicants are encouraged to contact a potential supervisor to discuss their research focus before applying. The statement of purpose to be included in the application needs to clearly set out the scope of the project and proposed method, as well as situate its relevance to the field and originality. The project must be able to be realistically completed within the three-year timeframe allotted for the PhD. This means that applicants must have a solid background in the methods and disciplines they utilize.

Visiting PhD students from other institutions are welcome depending on capacity and relevance to the research of at least one faculty member.
