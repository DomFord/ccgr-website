title: About the Center
---

The Center for Computer Games Research was formally established in 2003, building on ongoing work in the area at the ITU since its founding in 1999. The center houses a multi-disciplinary research group with backgrounds in the arts, humanities, social sciences and computer science. The group performs basic and applied research, approaching games from a variety of perspectives including theoretical analysis, design, ethnographic and qualitative approaches, AI, user (cognitive and affective) modeling and player experience.

Members of the group are involved in editorial boards of the most respected journals in the fields of game studies, game culture, game AI and affective modeling and IEEE Task Forces focusing on games.
